                                Like everything else in creation, our body too is run on the principle of balance and imbalance. When you are in a state of balance, you exude health, beauty, glow and radiance. You possess within you the magnetism and attraction of the entire creation. However, whenever there is imbalance, disease and ageing set in. These days most schools that are teaching yog follow a piecemeal approach. Today if you go out searching for a cure, you will find men claiming to be ‘yoga instructors’ selling exercises for eye-balls for sharper vision, abnormal breathing styles to reduce your waistline or ‘sanjeevni buti’ to rid you of a chronic ailment. Be warned that none of this is even remotely close to yog. In yog you do not see body as its different parts but in totality, as poorna. The term ‘yog’ itself means sum total, i.e. complete. A disease is just a symptom of an imbalance that exists somewhere else. What is required is to get yourself into balance, taking the body as whole, thereupon no disease can touch you.

                                Sanatan Kriya, as formulated by Yogi Ashwini, encapsulates in its entirety, all the eight limbs of Ashtang Yog as prescribed by the Patanjali Yog Sutras about 5000 years ago. It addresses the whole body, from core to the periphery, affecting all layers of a being. Its efficacy has been tried and tested by the doctors at Indian Medical Association. It promises no miracle cures but a healthy, happy and balanced physical, mental and emotional state as it is rooted in the principle of prakriti that is nature and balance and rids one of vikriti that is imbalance so that no negativity can enter you.

                                It comprises of five easy steps that can easily be adopted into the hectic schedule of modern man. Ujjai pranayam purifies the body. The basic joint rotations regularize the flow of prana in the body which gets congested at the joints and manifests into disease. The chakra santulan pranayam redistributes this prana in the various chakras, taking away prana from wherever there is surplus to the deficit areas. The paanch mahaprana dhyan balances the five vayus that control the physical body and balances the five elements. Dhyan with Guru takes the practitioner to a heightened level of consciousness from where he/she can affect any change in the physical and spiritual to aid his/her journey. Charity and service are an integral part of the kriya and indispensable for purification of the self, as well as growth. Practitioners of Sanatan Kriya at Dhyan Foundation are involved in a host of charitable activities – daily food distribution camps, schools for street children, supporting blind girls and cancer patients, feeding the dogs, protecting the cow, to name a few.

                                As one follows all the steps of Sanatan Kriya in totality, the body comes in balance and disease ceases to enter. When the various layers of the body get balanced, certain profound spiritual experiences follow. Health, beauty, radiance, emotional stability and financial growth are just some of the by-products that come along with regular practice of the kriya. The efficacy of this practice can be gauged from the phenomenal experiences that the practitioners at Dhyan Ashram routinely encounter – past life experiences, divine interactions, escaping death by a whisker ... 51 of these cases have been documented in our publications, all of them backed with medical validations.

                                What makes Sanatan Kriya truly genuine and effective is that it is completely sanitized of commerce. In fact, this is what renders all the ‘yoga courses’ that are sold in the market ineffective. Yoga is a sadhna, not a business.
