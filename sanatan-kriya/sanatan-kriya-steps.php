                            After having studied ‘the being’ for more than a decade, Yogi Ashwini formulated the Sanatan Kriya, an assimilation of the eight limbs of Ashtang Yog as given in Patanjali Yog Sutras, without any dilutions and modifications. Sanatan Kriya offers an easy way to the modern, busy man to get himself into a state of balance - physical, emotional, financial and mental. Through regular practice one is able to access and control their pranic layers (the aura) to bring about any desired change in the physical from.Gradual and regular practice of the Kriya opens the doors to subtler dimensions bestowing the practitioner with amazing experiences in both physical as well as energy world and carve the way for spiritual evolution.

                            Ujjai is a simple yet powerful pranayam to purify the body and introduce a state of balance. Sit in vajra asana or any comfortable posture. Take your awareness to the breath at the tip of nostrils. As you inhale, expand your stomach like a balloon, while exhaling contract it. Keep your shoulders and chest relaxed, focussing on abdominal breathing. Introduce a slight hissing sound from the pit of the throat while inhaling and exhaling by slight constriction of the throat. Gradually, make your breath slower and deeper.

                            Your body is the vehicle to your soul. For intense practices, it is important to understand your body and to strengthen it. The basic joint rotations ensure health and longevity of the body by removing the spent prana that gets accumulated at your joints and ensuring free flow of energy in the body.

                            There are six joint rotations starting from the neck, moving downwards to the shoulders, wrists , hip joint, knees and finally ankles.
                            
                            <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
                                <li>Each joint needs to be rotated seven times in one direction and seven times in reverse direction.</li>
                                <li>All rotations are to be performed without straining any part of the body.</li>
                                <li>Coordinate your rotations with Ujjai breath, inhaling in half circle and exhaling in the other half.</li>
                                <li>Keep your eyes closed throughout the rotations, maintaining internal awareness of the joint being rotated.</li>
                            </ul>

                            Finally, perform the Taad Asana. Stand straight; going on your toes, making sure that your body weight is evenly distributed on both your feet. Once you are evenly balanced raise both your arms with palms facing the sky. Hold the posture while breathing in Ujjai.

                                    <strong>Udaan Vayu:</strong> Touch the first three fingers to the tip of your thumb. Udaan Vayu is the upwards rising force from the pit of your throat towards your head.
