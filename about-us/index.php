                    <p class="sec-para">
                        The Foundation is actively engaged in a host of charitable activities including free distribution of food at multiple places, saving wildlife and looking after injured animals (Feed a Dog, Save a Cow), running schools for street kids, sponsoring higher education of the poor, finding employment for the unemployed, spreading awareness about environmental issues etc. and all this is done without any government funding or selling any products, solely out of funds of Yogi Ashwini and from the contributions of the volunteers and well wishers. A unique concept at Dhyan Foundation is that the various centres collect and manage their own funds and resources.
