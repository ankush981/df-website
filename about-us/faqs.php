                    <!-- Questions related to The Guru-Shishya Parampara -->
                    <div>                   
                        <h3 class="para-heading">The Guru-Shishya Parampara</h3>
                        
                        <p><strong><em>Who teaches all that is taught here?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>The guiding light of Dhyan Foundation is Yogi Ashwini. He is a world-renowned yog-guru, and perhaps the only one, passing on the ancient vedic science of yog in its authentic and unadulterated form as per the ancient guru-shishya parampara.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>What is a Guru, and how is he different from a teacher? </em></strong></p>
                        <p>A teacher merely imparts knowledge, but a Guru is a channel through which the true and eternal gyan (not just intellectual knowledge) flows to you as per your ability to receive this.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Why do I need a Guru?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>If you are to rise above your intellect, and know yourself, you need gyan, not merely knowledge. This is possible only through a Guru, as only a true Guru has the capacity to make you evolve.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>I already have a Guru. Can I learn the practices here without following the Guru at Dhyan Foundation?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>If you already have a Guru, then you must pose this question to him/her and do as he/she says.</p>

                        <p><strong><em> If the initiation has happened once, and the Guru is no more in the physical world, then can you go to another living master?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Once the initiation has happened then it really is of no consequence whether you are in the physical presence of your Guru or not. You would have understood the true meaning of a Guru and would feel no need to go to another living master.</p>

                    <!-- Questions related to The Practices and Teaching -->
                    <div>                   
                        <h3 class="para-heading">The Practices and Teaching</h3>
                        
                        <p><strong><em>How long is the "course"?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>At Dhyan ashram , we do not believe in classes and courses , it is a one-to-one interaction between the guru and the shishya as per the ancient guru-shishya paramapara. You could acquire the gyan in a moment or may not be able to even after years , it all depends on your connection with your guru and your intent to acquire gyan. Sanatan Kriya must not be confused with an exercise routine , it is a sadhna , the deeper you go , the subtler becomes your energy body and the more glow and attraction you acquire , to not just attract men but even gods and goddesses. A basic three-month regular practice of Sanatan Kriya is essential to induce a state of balance in the various layers of a practitioner so that he can tread the path of yog.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>What do you teach at Dhyan Foundation?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>We teach yog, as it was laid down by the vedic seers, in totality and without any modifications or dilutions.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Why do I need to do exercises along with meditation?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Exercises are not recommended with any Yogic practice. Asana are recommended since they optimize the body metabolism, thereby prolonging the age of the physical body. Exercises on the other hand increase the body metabolism which, ultimately leads to wear and tear of the physical body. Patanjali Yog Sutras define Asana as “Sukham Sthiram Asanam”. The physical body comes in a state of balance by practicing asana and stillness can be achieved in the physical.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>What is the fee to be paid?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>There is no fee to be paid as the Foundation follows the Guru shishya paramapara.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Will I receive an initiation?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>That is for your Guru to decide.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Can I learn healing at Dhyan Foundation?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>There are many things you learn on the path of yoga, and healing could be one of them, if you are ready to be taught this. But the supreme purpose of yoga is evolution.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Will my kundalini awaken through what I practise here?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>That depends on the regularity of your practices and your connection with the Guru.</p>

                        <p><strong><em> Do I have to give up my lifestyle or anything in order to follow the teachings here?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>You are not asked to give up anything in this practice. If your practices are right then anything not suited for you will leave you on its own, with no effort on your part.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Do I have to be a vegetarian to follow yoga?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>There are no restrictions in Yog. Forcefully giving up a lifestyle or diet is second to violence and violence is contradictory to the Yogic philosophy. One is free to have any life style and any diet, vegetarian or non- vegetarian, depending upon what the body needs.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Is there a dress code?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>There is no dress-code. Though we recommend wearing comfortable, loose clothes, preferably natural fabric and avoiding any kind of perfumes/artificial fragrances for a dhyan session.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Can I do the practices while I am menstruating?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Yes, it is a natural phenomenon and hence it shouldn’t stop your from doing anything.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>I have already learnt the basics of yoga; is there an advanced course?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>As mentioned before, we do not believe in courses and classes. Yog is a one-to-one relationship between the guru and shishya, where the guru monitors and guides every shishya individually and prescribes a sadhna as per the capacity of an individual.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>I want to be a teacher of yoga; do you have a course for this?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>Whatever you learn here, you will at some point pass on to others, because you truly receive only when you share what you get. But just as you receive without any commercial consideration, so will you share in the same manner.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Why do your members wear yellow?</em></strong></p>
                        <p></p>

                        <p><strong><em>The science of Yog is based on the concept of Gyan, while knowledge can be acquired by reading. Knowledge remains only at the level of the intellect which still has a lot of scope for questioning, whereas, the concept of Gyan goes far beyond intellect and is totally experiential. In Yog the concept of Gyan can be acquired from everything around a Sadhak, thus a specific color and material are prescribed to the Sadhak from time to time based on the stage the Sadhak is at. </em></strong></p>
                        <p></p>

                        <p><strong><em>What do I achieve if I follow this path?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>You can never follow this path if you step into it with the aim of achieving something. Get into it only if you want to understand the true meaning of yoga and help others. What you get should be left to your Guru. Dhyan is done only for the purpose of evolution, which is the ultimate purpose of the soul, and is much above anything that can be achieved in the world.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Can I simultaneously practice other forms of yoga prescribed by any other organisations?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>When a practitioner starts with the sadhna there are some certain measurable changes which will start setting into the being of that individual. This is because the Kriya being taught at Dhyan Foundation is programmed by Yogi Ashwini to bring those changes around. Thus, you are guided at every step of your journey and you are given answers to all your queries with respect to your experiences. Your practices will also be altered based on your experience on a one on one basis. However, this responsibility ceases when you decide to mix and match, as per your convenience, practices as prescribed by any other organisation. It is imperative that you follow only one path at any given point of time and practice it at least for a 3-4 months without modifications. Your own experience will tell you whether you want to continue or not.</p>

                        <p><strong><em>Is there any formality in case I decide to quit?</em></strong></p>
                        <p>There is no formality in case you decide to quit. There are no bindings in Yog. You come as per your free will and you are free to leave if you so desire. We send communication with respect to the Foundation’s activities from time to time through emails and SMS. In case you wish not to receive them either, kindly inform your centre incharge and we will ensure that you do not get any information from us.</p>
